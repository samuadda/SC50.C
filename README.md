# CS50 C Track — Problem Set Solutions

![harvard cs50](cs50-harvard.png)

This repository contains my solutions to the C programming track of **CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science**.  
It includes my work during the course, organized by weeks and problem sets, all written in C.

> This repo represents an early foundational stage in my journey into programming, algorithms, and computer science concepts.

## 📚 About the Course

[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu) is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

In this C-focused part of the course, I worked on multiple problem sets that cover:

- Basic C syntax and compilation
- Conditions, loops, and functions
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and memory management
- Structs and data organization
- File I/O
- Algorithms (searching, sorting, etc.)

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repo contains multiple C files and folders corresponding to different problem sets and weeks of the course.  
Examples of what you’ll find:

- Simple console programs (input/output, loops, conditions)
- Small utilities and simulations
- Algorithmic exercises written in C

> File and folder names follow CS50’s original structure (e.g. per week / problem set).

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

To compile any file, you can use `gcc`:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o program
./program
```

Or, if you’re using the CS50 environment / make:
```bash
make program_name
./program_name
```
Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g. gcc or clang).

🎯 What This Repo Shows

Early hands-on experience with C

Exposure to core computer science fundamentals

Comfort with the terminal, compilation, debugging, and iterative problem solving

This repo is mainly archived as a reference to where I started, and as part of my learning history.
